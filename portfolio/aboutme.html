    <div class="blurb">
            <p>Hi there! I'm Amberly Lerner, a senior English and Communication double major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Specifically, I am studying how speech and rhetoric has shaped our present day culture (i.e. literature, television, film).</p>

            <p>I am also completing the Professional Writing and Technical Communication certificate. Through the certificate, I am learning about the imporance and technique of technical writing and UX/UI.</p>

            <p>In addition to my duties as a student, I also am the Senior Communications Assistant Commonwealth Honors College and write articles to promote the events and achievements of CHC faculty members and students.</p>
        
            <p>This past summer, I had an internship in User Experience Research at Envestnet, Inc., a fintech company in the Greater Philadelphia area. This professional experience imbued me with many UX skills, and a love for this kind of work.</p>
        
            <p>Upon graduation, I am hoping to gain more professional experience in UX, and make a career within this growing industry.</p>
