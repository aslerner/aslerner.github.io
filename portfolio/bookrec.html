              <h2>Chapter 1: It Begins</h2>
              <p>As Malcolm Gladwell once said, it takes 10,000 hours to become truly talented in something. In order to achieve that with UX, I looked for design challenges. Ultimately, I came across this one architected by <a href="https://lukejones.me/">Luke Jones</a>:</p>
              <p style="border-left: 1px #000 solid; padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 8px;">"Reading a book is a significant time investment and people want to know that the book they're about to read is worth their time. Suggest a user interface for book recommendations and ratings that doesn’t rely heavily on overall star-ratings, and instead on the nuanced tastes of the user."</p>
            <p>As someone who adores books, this felt like the perfect way to engage with both my career and my hobby.</p>

              <h2>Chapter 2: Research</h2>
              <p>The challenge seems simple enough. However, as designer Paul Rand once said, “Design is simple. That’s why it is so complicated.” I knew that if I wanted to do this challenge justice, I needed to conduct user research before I even considered where to place each button in the app itself.<br><br>
                  
              One of the best UX research methodologies, I had learned from my internship this past summer at Envestnet, was to conduct interviews, ideally in person so you can ask follow up questions more easily and catalogue any body language. 
                  
              <br><br>It’s harder to conduct a lot of interviews though when everyone is under quarantines and stay-at-home advisories, but I was able to determine sufficient alternatives: Google Forms surveys and phone interviews.<br><br>

              I had five factors for people to rate in the Google form: book summary, genre, themes, representation, and other people’s reviews (from “Not Very Important,” “A Little Important,” “Very Important,” to  “Extremely Important” in regards to how they chose their next read). <br><br>
                  
                  In addition, I included open-ended questions asking people to describe their process for choosing a new book, in their own words, and to let me know if there was anything else I needed to know. By including those questions, I allowed the opportunity for new factors I had not considered before. I also included questions about demographics.<br><br>
                  
                  For the interviews conducted over the phone, I asked similar questions. The primary difference between the two methodologies was that the surveys, in order to encourage as many people to respond anonymously, did not allow me to find participants to ask follow up questions if I had any about their answers.<br><br>
                  
                  33 people total completed the Google Survey for the book recommendation challenge. All in all, the most surprising insight I gained was how many people considered covers in their decision making process, despite the adage that you shouldn’t judge books by their covers!<br><br>
                  
                  Many of the survey participants indicated that the book summary and the genre were the most important factors. The demographic questions proved to be incredibly important; while not everyone said that representation was an important factor in their decision, the ones who said it was extremely important belonged to more marginalized groups.

              <h2>Chapter 3: Design, Design Design!</h2>
              <p>Once the primary research was completed, I made various UX deliverables to further plan my challenge response. <br><br>
                  
            I began first by taking the data I had on my users and making them concrete through creating user personas. I envisioned 3 potential users who may use the app produced by challenge, and the different goals, difficulties, and needs that potential users may have. I compiled all these personas through InDesign and free stock photos from Unsplash.<br><br>

                  I then proceeded to think more specifically about how these users would interact with the app by creating customer journey maps, a UX standard of visually representing path of the customer’s ideal app experience. It was here that I began to consider the tabs, screens, and buttons that the user may come across, and how that would change depending on what their goal was or decision made. <br><br>
                  
                  With this established, I finally sketched out the wireframes on paper, roughly placing everything on the screen before I took the time to reacquaint myself with the prototyping software.

              <h2>Chapter 4: Prototyping</h2>
              <p>For this app, I decided to use Adobe XD, an industry standard software. As I already have the entire Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, it made the most sense to use, financially and logistically.<br><br>
                
                I have used Adobe XD in the past to make a prototype for a potential website design. However, I soon realized that mobile apps have different design conventions than websites do.</p>
