              <h2>Chapter 1: It Begins</h2>
              <p>As Malcolm Gladwell once said, it takes 10,000 hours to become truly talented in something. In order to achieve that with UX, I looked for design challenges. Ultimately, I came across this one architected by <a href="https://lukejones.me/">Luke Jones</a>:</p>
              <p style="border-left: 1px #000 solid; padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 8px;">"Reading a book is a significant time investment and people want to know that the book they're about to read is worth their time. Suggest a user interface for book recommendations and ratings that doesn’t rely heavily on overall star-ratings, and instead on the nuanced tastes of the user."</p>
            <p>As someone who adores books, this felt like the perfect way to engage with both my career and my hobby.</p>

              <h2>Chapter 2: Research</h2>
              <p>The challenge seems simple enough. However, as designer Paul Rand once said, “Design is simple. That’s why it is so complicated.” I sat down and realized that if I wanted to do this challenge justice, I would need to do a lot of user research before I even considered where to place each button in the apps themselves.<br><br>
              One of the best ways of conducting UX research, I had learned from my internship this past summer at Envestnet, was to conduct interviews, ideally in person so you can ask follow up questions more easily and catalogue any body language. 
                  <br><br>It’s harder to conduct a lot of interviews though when everyone is under quarantines and stay-at-home advisories, but I was able to determine sufficient alternatives: Google Forms surveys and phone interviews.<br><br>
I first took a moment to consider how people determined what books to read, if there wasn’t a website label of how many stars out of 5 the book averaged. I knew from my personal experience that bookstores are organized by genre, with occasional highlights from booksellers. Libraries are organized similarly. <br><br>
                  In regards to the specific book itself, I tend to consider the plot summary on the inside flap and the themes I got from that summary. As someone who is a mixed race, queer, and Jewish, representation is also a rather critical factor into whether or not I invest time and mental energy into reading a book.
<br><br>
Hence, I had five factors I had people rate in the Google form: book summary, genre, themes, representation, and other people’s reviews (with four options from “Not Very Important,” “A Little Important,” “Very Important,” and  “Extremely Important” in regards to how they chose their next read). <br><br>
                  In addition, I included open-ended questions asking people to describe their process for choosing a new book, in their own words, and to let me know if there was anything else I needed to know. By including those questions, I allowed the opportunity for new factors I had not considered before. I also included questions about demographics.<br><br>
For the interviews conducted over the phone, I asked similar questions – the primary difference was that the surveys, in order to encourage as many people to respond anonymously, did not allow me to find participants to ask follow up questions if I had any about their answers (though admittedly, this presented itself as more of an issue with the pet sitting and voting challenges).<br><br>
A grand total of 33 people completed the Google Survey for the book recommendation challenge. All in all, the most surprising insight I gained was how many people considered covers in their decision making process, despite the adage that you shouldn’t judge books by their covers!<br><br> Many of the survey participants indicated that the book summary and the genre were the most important factors. The demographic questions proved to be incredibly important; while not everyone said that representation was an important factor in their decision, the ones who said it was extremely important belonged to more marginalized groups.
